## Install

We provide two ways to use Cuis. One is a previously built desktop application,
batteries included. The other one is a local client-server Node.js Express
application.

### Local client-server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martjanz/cuis
cd cuis
yarn build
yarn serve
```

## Development setup

### Backend server (Node.js - Express)

```bash
cd server
yarn start
```

### Frontend server (React)

cd server
yarn start
```
